## Plugins

We have created a separate space [vss-cli-contrib](https://gitlab-ee.eis.utoronto.ca/vss-cli-contrib) 
to host a collection of third-party code that extends the capabilities of the 
**ITS Private Cloud Command Line Interface** (``vss-cli``).

Contact [JM Lopez](https://gitlab-ee.eis.utoronto.ca/jm.lopez) if you want to put your project here.
